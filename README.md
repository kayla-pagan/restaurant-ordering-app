# Restaurant Ordering App

## About

This app has given allowed me to explore new JS concepts that I was not too comfortable with such as:

- SetTimeout()
- Utilizing data attributes to target items I needed to interact with  
- forEach() instead of for...of to loop over arrays

I created this app according to a design file given to me on Figma. Then I chaged/added a few of my own touches including the logo and images.
